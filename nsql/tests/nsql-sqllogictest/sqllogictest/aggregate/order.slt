# FIXME allow referencing alias in ORDER BY
# the way to implement this is probably to do the order by after the projection
# but extend the projection to include any required columns of the order by expressions
# query II
# SELECT SUM(x) AS s FROM (VALUES(1), (2)) AS t(x) GROUP BY x ORDER BY s DESC
# ----
# 2
# 1

# allow aggregate function in ORDER BY
query I
SELECT SUM(x) AS s FROM (VALUES(1), (2)) AS t(x) GROUP BY x ORDER BY SUM(x) DESC
